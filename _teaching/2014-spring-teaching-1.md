As a part of my TA duties, I conducted discussions on topics in Optimization and Linear programming techniques such as Simplex, Hungarian, transportation problems etc. I was also responsible for grading and holding office-hours single handedly. I am extremely humbled that I have been ranked as "Excellent Teacher" for Fall 2017, with a rating of 4.3/5.0.
