I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. Prior to this, I pursued my Dual degree: Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Computer Science, from BITS, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I am advised by Prof Rakesh Nagi and am a prt of the C3SR team, a collaboration with IBM. 

Research Interests
======
My Research is focused on Optimization and Operations Research. I am currently focused on optimization in neural networks. I have worked on formulating real life applications into mixed integer programming problems and then involved in the design and development of accelerated algorithms for these problems. 

1.Multi Target Tracking
-----

Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) is a prominent computer vision problem that can be formulated as a Multi-dimensional Assignment Problem, that is NP-Hard. This project is a combination of both theory and computation. I have designed a dual-ascent based algorithm and then developed a GPU-accelerated code, that is enabled to handle about 25 billion variables. A provable optimal solution is found is found for most of the test cases.

 
2.Entity Resolution and Coreference.
-----
NLP applications like "Entity Coreference" and "Entity Resolution" are formulated as integer programming problems and accelerated algrotihms are developed. A better accuracy is guranteed. 

3.Traveling Salesman Problem
----

Accelerated algorithms are produced for TSP that provide good approximate solutions for large sized problems. 

Academic Projects
======
As a part of some of my courses at UIUC, I have pursued the following projects. 

1. Show and Tell
-----
I worked on building a generative model with a deep recurrent architecture to automatically generate captions for an image using Pytorch. Trained a CNN (ResNet152) as image encoder with LSTM as decoder network and generated captions using beam search with beam size 2. Evaluated the captions using BLEU score, achieving a score of 16.31 as against 27.7 by the paper authors

Background
=====
I graduated with my M.Sc (Honors) in Mathematics and B.E (Honors) in Computer Science (dual degree) from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in 2017. I pursued my Masters' thesis externally at IIT Bombay in the Fall Semester of 2016.
