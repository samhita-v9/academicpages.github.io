I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. Prior to this, I pursued my Dual degree: Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Computer Science, from BITS, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I am advised by Prof Rakesh Nagi and am a part of the C3SR team, a collaboration with IBM. 

Research Interests
======
My Research is focused on Optimization and Operations Research. I am currently focused on optimization in neural networks. I have worked on formulating real life applications into mixed integer programming problems and then involved in the design and development of accelerated algorithms for these problems. 

1.Multi Target Tracking
-----

Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) is a prominent computer vision problem that can be formulated as a Multi-dimensional Assignment Problem, that is NP-Hard. This project is a combination of both theory and computation. I have designed a dual-ascent based algorithm and then developed a GPU-accelerated code, that is enabled to handle about 25 billion variables. A provable optimal solution is found is found for most of the test cases.

 
2.Entity Resolution and Coreference.
-----
NLP applications like "Entity Coreference" and "Entity Resolution" are formulated as integer programming problems and accelerated algrotihms are developed. A better accuracy is guranteed. 

3.Traveling Salesman Problem
----

Accelerated algorithms are produced for TSP that provide good approximate solutions for large sized problems. 

Academic Projects
======
As a part of some of my courses at UIUC, I have pursued the following projects. 



1. A survey on Visual Question Answering on Medical Datasets
-----

Course: Natural Language Processing Course Project, CS 447, UIUC

As a part of this project, I performed an extensive literature review on Visual Question Answering with a focus on medical data and identified challenges when dealing with medical data. Visual Question Answering (VQA) in medical data is more complex than general data because the questions are very specific and the answers are highly detailed. I was interested in understanding different kinds of deep learning models that could be used to tackle such issues. I am currently exploring the idea of using Dynamic Neural Modules (DNM) for VQA on medical datasets. 


2. Analysis of the instabilities in neural networks in medical image reconstruction      
-----

Course: Machine Learning in Signal Processing Course Project, CS 598 PS, UIUC

As a part of this project, I analyzed performance of four prominent neural network architectures in presence of adversarial attacks and instabilities. Medical image reconstruction is an inverse problem and lately deep learning models are rising up to show better performance than the traditional models such as compressed sensing, parallel image sensing. However, these models are susceptible to instabilities when faced with adverserial attacks. This project was focused on identifying the instabilities that could be caused and the reaction of four prominent deep learning networks to such instabilities. I am currently exploring tways to make these models robust.  






3. Show and Tell
-----

Course: Deep learning IE 598, UIUC

I worked on building a generative model with a deep recurrent architecture to automatically generate captions for an image using Pytorch. Trained a CNN (ResNet152) as image encoder with LSTM as decoder network and generated captions using beam search with beam size 2. Evaluated the captions using BLEU score, achieving a score of 16.31 as against 27.7 by the paper authors.

Background
=====
I graduated with my M.Sc (Honors) in Mathematics and B.E (Honors) in Computer Science (dual degree) from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in 2017. I pursued my Masters' thesis externally at IIT Bombay in the Fall Semester of 2016.
